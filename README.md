# Description

Many of us might have encountered this problem more often when you open your wardrobe and think you have nothing to wear and yet have a full wardrobe? We would definitely like the idea of getting up in the morning and getting dressed in no time? Then you are in luck and the right place. We thought to solve this problem by creating a digitalised wardrobe that ensures you wear everything you have in your wardrobe, most of the time we go out shopping for fashion forward clothes that are attractive but rarely wear them afterwards may be because you either don’t have a fitting pair or accessories.

And there comes the concept helps you to declutter your closet, create various options for you to wear instead of stuffing items you will never put on and also saves you a lot of money that you would have otherwise used to buy more clothes.

## Problems Encountered

- It took us almost three hours to find out a bug in linking two pages
- Was a bit difficult to connect database and show connectivity while linking
